## Introduction

The main purpose of this repository is to showcase what I can do. This is also a constant work in progress to learn new designs, architecture, technologies where my main goal is to be the most efficient in my craft and offering the best/simple solutions for the job.

The more I study Domain Driven Design, the more I realise that this concept answers a lot of issues I've had building software over the years. 

Here are some of the key concepts and articles which drives my thinking today:

1. [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/tags/domain%20driven%20design.html)
2. [Event Sourcing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing)
3. [Cloud Design Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/)
